# Parallax tutorial 2018

The PDF file cluster_inference.pdf explains more precisely the approach for inferring cluster distance and size/shape.

There are three python notebooks with exercises which illustrate the statistical methods covered in the lectures.
In your root directory put the notebooks (*.ipynb) into a directory called "notebook/", the R codes (*.R) into a directory called "Rcode/", and the data (*.csv) in a directory called "data/". The root directory is then defined in the first line of each notebook.
